            <p class-"mt-2">Government is not working.</p>

            <p class-"mt-2">You feel it. I feel it. And when government doesn’t work, people, communities, and the planet suffer.</p>

            <p class-"mt-2">But here’s the truth: government matters more now than ever.</p>

            <p class-"mt-2">A good government helps us face big challenges like climate change, rising costs, and unfair systems. It helps protect the environment, support communities, and build a safer, fairer future.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">And right now, government is falling short of the moment we’re living in.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">This is where Civic Punks come in.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2"><span class="font-bold">Civic Punks are hopeful rebels, inside and outside government, who know our systems aren’t working the way people and the planet need — and who care enough to speak up, fix what’s broken, and build something better for everyone.</span></p>

             <p class-"mt-2">Hi, I’m <span class="font-bold">Derek Alton</span>, a proud Canadian and a wannabe Civic Punk.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">For the last 17 years, I’ve been exploring the future of government — as an academic, an activist, a public servant in the Government of Canada, and most recently at Apolitical, where I worked with public servants from all over the world.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">I’ve met thinkers, builders, dreamers, and doers across countries and continents. These people are my friends and my community. They inspire me every day, and I believe their work is quietly changing the world — even if most people don’t see it yet.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">I’m curious about them. I want to learn from them.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">So I’m traveling around the world to find Civic Punks face to face — to see what they’re building, what they’re trying, what gives them hope, and how they’re helping shape a better future.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">This channel is where I share that journey.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">Here, you’ll find short videos, travel diaries, and simple explanations that cut through the jargon and show what the future of government could look like. This isn’t “Government 101.”</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">It’s a guide to what government needs to become — for people, for communities, and for the planet.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">You’ll meet the people fixing what’s broken and building what comes next. And you’ll see why this moment matters so much.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">But this isn’t just my journey.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">It’s <span class="font-bold">our</span> journey.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">Come with me — join the conversation, ask questions, share ideas, and help shape where this goes.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">You can do that by liking, subscribing, sharing with a friend, or just reaching out to <a href="mailto:derakalton@civicpunks.com" class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800">derekalton@civicpunks.com</a> or on <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/derek-alton-99ab8921" class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800">Linkedin</a>.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">Welcome to Civic Punks.</p>

             <p class-"mt-2">Let’s explore the future of government — and help build something better, together.</p>
